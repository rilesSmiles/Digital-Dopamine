  <h1>DIGITAL DOPAMINE IS FOR THE DREAMERS AND THE DOERS.</h1>
  <H4 class="bold-line">"95% of people give up on their dreams,"</H4>
  <h4>says the Medium. Sad, right? Join myself and the rest of the 5% in playing an active role in your life. Let's learn, imagine, create, and show the world what the f*ck we're made of!</h4>
  <h4>I've always been a dreamer. I've spent my whole life with the belief that I was made to break the mold. Made to be challenged and to chanllenge others. Made to change the world.</h4>
  <h4>In a meeting with instructor Stephen Peasley at SAIT, discussing this very website- He said something that will stick with me forever,
  <h4 class="bold-line"> "learning is something you do, not something that happens to you."</h4> 
  <h4>Now this struck a chord. We musn't waste our time waiting around for great things to happen, because that isn't how life works. 
  <h4 class=bold-line>The greatness is in our hands.</h4> 
  <h4>So may we bask in it. May we throw it up in the air and let it rain down upon us. To the DREAMERS and the DOERS: Make sh*t happen. You know you have it in you.</h4>

  <H1>Now that you know what we believe in...</H1>
  <h4>Digital dopamine is a podcast for the ages. Sharing my thoughts on new trends, new technologies. Chatting with industry professionals. Getting their takes, learning from their wisdom. Promoting lifelong learning to the next level.</h4>
  <h4>Now I'll be honest, I'm no expert. I'm learning the ins and outs as I go along- through my classes at SAIT, and all sorts of projects I pick up along the way. But, wether you're learning too, or you're a seasoned vet already: my hope is that this podcast will bring you joy, and help you fall EVEN DEEPER in love with your career.</h4>
